    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>
        Takoyaki is a popular Japanese snack food originating from Osaka. 
        These are savory, ball-shaped snacks made from a batter of wheat flour, eggs, and dashi (Japanese stock), 
        filled with small pieces of octopus, green onions, and pickled ginger. 
        The mixture is poured into a special griddle with half-spherical molds.

        As the batter cooks, it's rotated to create a round shape. Once golden brown
        and crispy on the outside, takoyaki is typically served hot, topped with takoyaki 
        sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce), mayonnaise, dried bonito flakes, and seaweed flakes. 
        It's a delicious and iconic street food in Japan, enjoyed by many as a snack or appetizer.
