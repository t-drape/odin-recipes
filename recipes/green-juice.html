    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>Green Juice is one of my favorites. It embodies summer, with refreshing hints of citrus,
        bitter offsets by the kale, and zingy heat from the ginger. Not only is it delicious, but it 
        also is a formidable foe for any unwanted bacteria. From juices, you can get more servings of veggies
        in an enjoyable fashion.</p>
        <p>You also get vast amounts of vitamins and nutrients. In addition, the ginger adds 
        a boost of immunity. Green Juice provides a nice kick of energy in the morning, gives a 
        refreshing, healthy thirst-quencher for lunch, and can even be a finishing note to one's day.
        But most important, this recipe is just a suggestion. Tweak your juice, play around with the ingredients,
        find what you like best, and, above all, Enjoy!</p>
